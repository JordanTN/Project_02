PCB of Etch-a-Sketch
By Jordan Ngo

As a part of ENGI301, I have created a PCB design of an Etch-a-Sketch toy. 
This Etch-a-Sketch has two potentiometers to control the drawing, a button to reset the game, 
a button to change the colors, 3 LEDs to indicate the color of drawing (red, greem, blue), and an SPI display.
